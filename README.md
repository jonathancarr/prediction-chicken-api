# prediction-chicken-api
An API for New Zealand rugby match data and predictions

My intitial implementation of the [Prediction Chicken](https://github.com/jonathancarr/prediction-chicken) was a fun introduction to web development, but obviously no one wants to be stuck maintaining the first shoddy website they ever built, so I'm flipping the table and starting afresh!

This repo contains a Rails API-only application that will be used to a fuel a brand-spankin' new front-end soon.
